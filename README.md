# SwiggyProject
The objective is to build a recommendation system based on restaurant data provided in a CSV file.

It suggests restaurants based on user preferences such as city, cuisine, rating, and price.


ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ… Data Cleaning â€“ Handles missing values, formats ratings & prices.

âœ… One-Hot Encoding â€“ Encodes categorical features (city, cuisine, etc.).

âœ… Pickled Encoder (encoder.pkl) â€“ Saves & reuses the trained encoder.

âœ… Recommendation Engine â€“ Uses Cosine Similarity to suggest restaurants.

âœ… Streamlit UI â€“ Interactive app for selecting user preferences.

âœ… Mapping â€“ Recommendations are displayed from the cleaned dataset (human-readable).
